## LAN-Analyzer

I made this simple cpp program for myself to keep track of devices connected to my LAN.
It shows you list of addresses in your LAN, and saves them to .txt file.
If the address is new and not in the .txt file, it will tell you that new address has been found.
You can give "quick" as a command-line argument, to get a quick overview about the addresses.
